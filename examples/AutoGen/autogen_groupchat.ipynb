      "\n",
      "1. **Data Collection:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that the script includes error handling for potential issues with the arXiv API, such as rate limits or downtime.\n",
      "   - Consider adding a filter for specific keywords related to LLM applications to refine the search results further. This could include terms like \"GPT,\" \"transformer,\" \"NLP,\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Analysis:**\n",
      "   - It might be beneficial to define a preliminary list of domains before the analysis begins. This can help streamline the categorization process and ensure consistency.\n",
      "   - Consider including a method for handling papers that may span multiple domains. A multi-domain tagging system could be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Markdown Table Creation:**\n",
      "   - In addition to the title, authors, domain, and link, consider adding a column for the publication date. This will provide context regarding the recency of the research.\n",
      "   - Ensure that the markdown table is responsive and visually appealing, especially if it will be viewed on different platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review and Feedback:**\n",
      "   - It may be helpful to involve a third party (e.g., another scientist or engineer) in the review process to provide an additional layer of scrutiny and ensure objectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Submission:**\n",
      "   - Before submission, ensure that the markdown document includes a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the table and any relevant context about the LLM applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Verifiable Information:**\n",
      "  - Make sure to include the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This is crucial for verification and allows readers to access the original research easily.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Documentation:**\n",
      "  - Document the process and any challenges encountered during data collection and analysis. This can be useful for future reference or for others who may want to replicate the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Overall, the plan is solid and covers the necessary steps to achieve the objective. By incorporating the feedback above, you can enhance the robustness and clarity of the final output. Please let me know if you would like to discuss any specific points further or if there are additional requirements to consider.\n",
